Wireless Wonders: meet your new best friend, and musical pal!  

At Audio  Doctor we don't believe that you should have to suffer in silence, or use your phone's tiny little speakers to make music, instead, we have stylish, easy to use, fantastic sounding music making machines, from the best names in high performance audio: Bluesound, Devialet, Naim, and Paradigm.

For a single room or many rooms, for your serious music lover, or the casual listener, Audio Doctor has the tools to make your home come alive with the sound of music.  

Where do we start, we need to find out what kind of music listener are you?   Do you value ultimate simplicity over how good something sounds? Do you mind seeing your music making device or would you prefer a more stealthy, integrated solution? 

If you don't mind looking at your device then we would start with the Naim QB, $995.00 per room. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fd835761-164f-44a1-ae87-a4f0183ae2f5.jpg)
