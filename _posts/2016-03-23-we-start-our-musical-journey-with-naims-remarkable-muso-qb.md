We start our musical journey with the amazing sounding, Naim Muso QB This little metal box contains a surprising amount of power 450 watts  and multiple speakers. The Muso streams all of your favorite music from Spotify, Tidal, Airplay and more! You can control the QB from any IOS or Android device.  Think of this as the modern equvilant of the boom boxes of yore, no a Naim QB won't sound as real as a more exotic and expensive conventional multi piece sound system, however, for many users it is the perfect entry  into the world of high quality sound. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5fbbda9f-c9fe-4c60-be4d-e606a67b80e5.jpg)
