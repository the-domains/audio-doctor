**What's an Audio Doctor, and why you need one?**

In today's busy world you deserve some quality, me time. Time to relax with some great music, or to immerse yourself in a great TV show or movie.  Music sets our mood, it is our friend to motivate or inspire us, to pick us up when we are down, to get ourcreative juices flowing. We all love music!

The problem  is  most people don't have experience in selecting equipment  which will really suit their needs, there are so many brands at so many different price points, with so many features, and all of this creates confusion. Sure you can turn to Amazon, but how many Amazon users have spent the time in research, testing, and understanding technology to become our advocate? 

Or you can journey down to your big box retailor with poorly set up displays, and barely trained employees who might have just as much experience in video game play then being your guide to selecting great home entertainment products.  

Wouldn't it be great to have your own personal  Audio Doctor, someone who can advocate and recommend the perfect solution to bring the joy of music and movies, into your home, someone with a world of experience and a trained ear. Someone who understands what quality is all about!

Welcome to Audio Doctor, your prescription for fun!
